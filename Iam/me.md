#                             Who Am I :grey_question:

### A little about me:

- A human being in general disagreed with the things themselves, because i believe thaT we can always modify and create more efficient features, which allows us to face problems and, above all, solves them from different points of view, since the world we live in is multiple. So, i think that we, sapiens, also need to have the multidisciplinary capacity in order to not only better understand ourselves, but also to capture the desires of society and make it an increasingly better environment in which to live.
